6 issues were found when checking AAR metadata:

1. Dependency 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat-resources:1.6.0' requires libraries and applications that
depend on it to compile against version 33 or later of the
Android APIs.
    
    :app is currently compiled against android-32.
    
    Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdkVersion
    of at least 33, for example 33.
    
    Note that updating a library or application's compileSdkVersion (which
    allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
    targetSdkVersion (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
    minSdkVersion (which determines which devices the app can be installed
    on).
